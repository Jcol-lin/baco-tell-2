			<!-- SEO Tactics: At the beginning of this page you will see a list of meta tags, that is my first
			tactic I utilized with the help of Soovle and Google Trends which I'm counting as my second tactic as I used both of 
			those to look at keywords and trends through the taco and food truck industries to gather helpful keywords. 
			My other tactic is using keywords together that a customer might be looking for like in the copy of the home page
			and in the descriptions of things like the food and staff pages. -->
			
			<!-- Artificial Intelligence was used four times in the making of this site. The first would be on the "Staff" page 
			where the photos were taken from "Thispersonisnotreal.com" to make the employees. The second time would be on the color scheme.
			I actually decided after looking at the real taco bell webpage that these days they use mostly whties, grays, and purples. Along
			with engaging photos and logos rather than a lot of colors, to be honest. However, I still used "Colormind.io" to help generate
			some colors for the website. The third place would be in the homepage welcome paragraph, the food page, the about us page, and the 
			staff page. All of these were very largely written by "ChatGPT." All of these are also cited indivdually and in more detail. "Logomaster.ai"
			was also used in the process of making this cite but moreso for brainstorming before I settled on the idea of exactly what 
			I wanted my logo to be. -->
